# PGUI
Blender Game Engine GUI System

# Installing / Using

You need to make a folder named "pgui" and place all the contents of this repo and make sure this folder is in the same place as your game .exe.
You can permanently place the folder inside Blender's Lib folder, so whenever you save a game as .exe, the Lib folder will be automatically copied.

... And please give credit to the original author if you're going to copy it. I WILL find out if you copy it >:)
